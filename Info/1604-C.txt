   The OS uses binary number system to represent data. The OS and programming languages has ability to transform human number systems to binary and vice-versa.

    Following are commonly used number system by the human-user:
      1. decimal -- base of 10
      2. octal   -- base of 8
      3. hexa decimal - base of 16


      Octal Number System
      -------------------
	Decimal		Octal         
	0		0
	1		1
	2		2	
	3		3
	4		4
	5		5
	6		6
	7		7
	8		10 

  8 | 8     Remainder
  --|----   
  8 | 1       0
  --|----     1  ^
                 |

        Hexa decimal number
       --------------------
	Decimal		Hexa
	0		0
        ....
	9		9
	10		A or a
	11		B or b
	12		C or c
 	13 		D or d
	14 		E or e
	15		F or f



C Program Structure
===================================================================

C Language is general purpose programming language. You can use C languae to develop web site, database oriented task, networking applications, low-level service applications, utilities apps and games. In fact C is just like a plain-paper and you're an artist - Draw anything you like.

C language is developed by itself.

About of C language:

    1. C Language is case-sensitive language. Upper case and lower       case names are significant.

    2. C Language source program file should have .c or .h extension.
       (.c stands for 'see' and .h for 'header' file).

    3. C Language object program has .exe extension in Window OS and
			             .out or no-extension in other OS.

    4. Each C Program must have one and only one main() function. The        main() is start-point of application. The OS will launch your 	program by calling "main()" function.


       What is a "function"? The word 'function' means a small and             independent C program.


C Program
=========

_____________________________
first section -- To include 
		 header files
_______________________________
int main()
 {
                  <== main() function - second section
 }
________________________________
Third section - To define user defined functions


A C program file is composed of three logical sections:

 1. File inclusion section 
    This section helps the C compiler to compare the syntax of C     statements and functions.

 2. main() function -- It is also called entry-point of your app.

 3. You can define user-defined functions/programs after or before the     main() function.

           
    5. Each C programming statement should ends with semi-colon. It means C statement is terminated with the ; (semi-colon).

       e.g  

            printf("\nHello World"); <-- semi-colon
