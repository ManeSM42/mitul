Loop statement
======================================================================
Loop statement is used to repeat one or more statement n-times or till condition is true.

With selection statemens - if and switch, we can execute selective statements or we can jump to a block or ignore a code of block. The loop statement allow us to repeat a code.

Three loop statements:

   1. for loop
   2. while loop and
   3. do  while loop


All three statements serve the common purpose except they have different syntax.


for loop
==================================

 Syntax:

  for(initialization; condition; increment_or_decrement)
  {
    body of for loop
  }

 for loop has three expressions: 

      1. initialization -- To initialize the loop control variables 
      2. condition      -- It determines how many times a body of loop
			   will be executed. 

 			   The loop statement will be terminated when
			   condition expression evalutes false.

     3. Incr/Decr expression -- To perform arithmetic operations on
				loop control variable.


Example: 


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

 int a;

     +----------- Init will be executed once when loop begins (1)
     |    +------- If condition is true then execute the body (2)
     V    V          and if it is false stops the loop statement
 for(a=1;a<=5;a++)
               ^
  {            |----------------(4)
    printf("\nHello");
  } <------------------ After executing body, incr/decr expression
			 will be executed (3)
}

Example: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int a,b;

  for(a=1,b=2; a<=3 && b>=0; a++, b--)
  {
     printf("\n%i  %i",a,b);
  }
}

You can add two or more expressions in initialization and incr/desc using comma (,) seperator operator.

Dry Run (Test the correctness of code)
---------------------------------------       Output  1   2
                                                      2   1
 a    b     a<=3      b>=0                            3   0
 1    2      1         1 
 2    1      1         1 
 3    0      1         1
 4    -1     0         0

Example:

for loop has three expressions(clauses) and these are optional. You just need to put semi-colon between three exprs.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  for(;;)
   {
     printf("\nHello");
    }
}

 There is no init clause.
 There is no incr/decr clause. but 
 here is value of condition clause is true so this loop will not stopped/terminate (infinite). You need to press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break to stop the program.
  

Example:

 int a;
 for(a=10;a;a--)
 {
   printf("\n%d",a);
  }

Dry run
--------
a          a (condition)
10          1 (true)
9           1 
8           1

1
0            0<-- loop will be stopped
