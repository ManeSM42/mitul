What is Java?

   The "Java" is platform to develop, deploy (install) and execute
   Java programs.

   There are three Java Platforms for different types of applications:
 
      1. Java SE (Standard Edition) - (Which we are learning)
      2. Java EE (Enterprize Edition)
      3. Java ME (Micro Edition)

      
   Java SE 
   =========

   It is the prime platform for Java EE and ME. The software which installs Java SE is called Java Developer Kit (JDK). Current version of JDK or Java SE is 8 (1.8.0) - The Java SE 8.


  The JDK/Java SE bundle is composed of 

       1. The Java Programming language
       2. The Java Core Class (Types) Library. Also known as           Application Programming Interface - API
       3. The Java Runtime Environment - JRE.


  1. The Java Language

     The Java Language is a statically and strongly typed programming      language. 
     The Java language supports a new program design technique called      "Object Oriented Paradigm/Programming". In C Language, we've      learnt procedure (function) oriented program design. The Java extends the function (procedure) oriented program and the new program design is called OOP.

     
  2. The Java Core APIs 

     It is fully object oriented class library. Java's class library is      completely designed using object-oriented paradigm/approach and to use Core APIs, one must have to adpot the OOP design.


     There are approx 3000 different datatypes (in Java, they are      called classes, interfaces, enums, and annotations) for      representing simple data to complex data.

     The Java Platform uses "package" system to organize the      datatypes/classes. The 'package' is a mechanism to create a group of related classes and keep one group of classes distinct from another group of classes.

      In fact the package is a file system folder in an OS.

      
  3. The Java Runtime Environment - JRE

      The JRE is rich runtime environment which provides number of runtime services to the Java program on behalf of the developer and these services include 

       1. Compilation of code
       2. Memory allocation
       3. Automatic Memory deallocation -- The Garbage Collector
       4. Thread - A technique to execute two or more methods                    concurrently.
       5. Code security
          and many more .....



Installing and configure JDK
=============================

1 Download JDK from oracle site -- www.oracle.com

2 After installing the JDK you will find

x:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x  folder and this folder is called   JAVA_HOME. 

3. Inside the JAVA_HOME folder we've "bin" folder. The "bin" folder contains Java compiler ("javac.exe") , Java Launcher or Java Virtual Machine (java.exe) and many more tools.

4. Set Path environment variable

    Path = x:\xyz;x:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x\bin

5. open command prompt and issue

   >javac  
   >java

   To test the path of Java compiler and launcher.
