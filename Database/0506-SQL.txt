Example: Table "Category" (It represent product category. e.g pencil, pen etc) has "Product" child table.


>create table category
(
   category_id number(3) primary key,
   category_name varchar2(20)
);

>create table product
(
  product_id number(3) primary key,
  category_id number(3),
  product_name varchar2(30),
  product_rate number(15,2),
  product_unit varchar2(10),
  foreign key (category_id) references category(category_id)
);


>insert into category values (1,'Pen');
>insert into category values (2,'Pencil');
>insert into product values (1,1,'Rotomac',5.5,'Nog');
                               ^
                               |--- Pen category id



Create SQL script file and execute SQL statements
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create SQL script file in which you can store SQL statements.

>ed filename  

   This command creates/opens a file using notepad and type SQL    statements in it.

To execute SQL statement from the file

>@filename

Example:

>ed c:\mitul\sample  (Press enter)

  sample.sql
  -----------
  select * from dept;
  select * from emp;
  
   [save & Close]

>@c:\mitul\sample     (Press enter)


Fetch rows from two or more tables based upon the value of same datatype and same size columns of different tables
===================================================================

 Syntax:

   SELECT Table1.Column1, Table2.Column1,...
            FROM Table1, Table2
              WHERE Table1.Column1 = Table2.Column2;


OR use table alias (second name of table)

  SELECT a.Column1, b.Column1,....
             FROM Table1 a, Table2 b
                 WHERE a.Column1 = b.Column2;

       [Note: a and b are aliases of table "Table1" and "Table2"               respectively.]
             


List Dept name , location and employee name from Dept and emp table.

>select dept.deptname,dept.location,emp.ename
          from dept,emp
             where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;

Or

>select a.deptname,a.location,b.ename
          from dept a,emp b
             where a.deptno = b.deptno;

List Category name, product name, rate and unit.

>select a.category_name, 
        b.product_name,
        b.product_rate,
        b.product_unit
          FROM category a,
               product b
             WHERE a.category_id = b.category_id;

Retreving rows from two or more tables is known as "JOINS". Most probably primary and foreign key columns are used by the JOINs.


Nested Query
------------------------------------------------------------
The SQL statement inside another SQL statement is called "Nested" query.


  Syntax:

   SELECT xxxxxx FROM table 
                   WHERE expression ( SELECT xxxxx FROM table ....);

   The inner most query will be executed first and based upon the value of inner most query the outer query will be executed.

Example:

 Display all employees whose location is "Meh"
 >select * from emp
       where deptno in (select deptno from dept where location='MEH');
 
Display all emps whose location is not 'Meh'
  >select * from emp
       where 
        deptno not in (select deptno from dept where location='MEH');
